A _residual graph_ is a special form of a [[Flow Network|flow network]] where each edge has already taken a given amount of [[Flow Network|flow]] and has some [[Residual Capacity|residual capacity]] associated with it.

If a given edge has any [[Residual Capacity|residual capacity]] left, that is represented on a _residual graph_ with another new edge equal to the [[Residual Capacity|remaining capacity]].
